<i><small>Image of the 640x480 NASDAQ chart captured 01-18-2011</small></i></p>

<p>
<b>Update: 10-10-2011</b> - New versions should be up real soon now. Loads and updates in near real-time up to 500 symbols.
</p>

<p><b>Update: 05-09-2011</b> - Unfortunately these Google Docs spreadsheets are no longer operating correctly. The importData function no longer automatically imports the latest list of symbols from Nasdaq.com and this in turn prevents the charts from displaying. It will take some time to work out a suitable alternative...<br /> ;-(</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>These are demos of a work-in-progress. There are many errors to be corrected and many new features in the pipeline. Your observations and suggestions on both are welcome.<p>
<p>Objective:
<ul>
<li>Monitor the movement all 6,600+ US stocks</li>
<li>Do this in near real-time with fewest views possible</li>
<li>Provide near instant spotting of the major outliers</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The stocks are displayed according to the three exchanges where they trade: NYSE. NASDAQ and AMEX.</p>
<p>There are two ways of viewing the stocks:
<ol>
<li>Google Docs Charts</li>
<li>Google Docs Spreadsheets</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Each method has quite specific features and limits.</p>
<h3>Charts</h3>
<p>Allow at least five minutes for charts to load - especially if you have not viewed the charts for a few days. You will probably see this message: "First and second columns must be entity and time" on a red background. Just keep on waiting. Load these charts well before you need to use them. Once loaded, however, the charts will use few of your computer's resources, will update every five minutes and can be left on all day. The charts are suitable for the occasional quick overview of the current market situation.
</p>
<h3>Spreadsheets</h3>
<p>The first time you open a spreadsheet, it loads as a chart, so it will take a long time to load. While the chart is loading, you can click on "Edit this chart". This will provide access to the editable spreadsheet as well as faster loading and updates times. You can open each tab to check if data is loaded. Spreadsheets update about once a minute. You will need a Google account in order to edit the spreadsheets. Prices are near real-time, volumes are delayed. The spreadsheets are more useful for the active trader or analyst - especially if custom warning and notifications are needed.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Features include zoom window, sector highlighting and select from index. See the notes below.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The methodologies used in these spreadsheets are at an early stage of development. The spreadsheets are known to stop or become mixed up. All results should be double-checked.</p>
<p>The charts are built using Adobe Flash and thus will not display on certain smartphones or tablets.</p>
<p>If a chart fails to display, do try to open the spreadsheet. The charts update every five minutes, while the spreadsheets update every minute or so.</p>
<p>Once a chart opens, click on 'Edit this page' in order to access the full spreadsheet and its tabs. If you want to edit things, click on File menu > Make a copy...</p>
<p>Each spreadsheet has two visualization worksheets - see the tabs at the bottom of each spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The sheet titled 'Gadget1' needs a refresh to update. Refresh by pressing F5 or View Menu > Reload or Control-R. Gadget1 is better when you are on an old computer or have a slow Internet connection. Also you can save certain default settings such as starting up with a log scale.</p>
<p>Chart1 updates automatically every minute or so. Use Chart1 if you have a computer with a good graphics card and a fast Internet connection.</p>
<p>Chart parameters:
<ul>
<li>X-Axis shows the percent of gain or loss of a stock since yesterdays close. Look for the zero somewhere near the middle</li>
<li>Y-Axis shows the percent of the current volume compared to the average daily volume. All stock start a zero in the morning and move up during the course of the day.</li>
<li>The diameter of a dot is its relative market capitalization. The larger the market capitalization, the bigger the dot.</li>
<li>The color of the symbol indicates the business sector of the company.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<p>Suggestions:
<ul>
<li>Move your mouse over any of the dots to display its symbol letter and associated data.</li>
<li>Make a zooming window by clicking twice in the chart area. Then click on "Zoom In".</li>
<li>When zoomed in, pan around the display by moving the box in Zoom window in lower right.</li>
<li>Hold your mouse over the colored boxes in the Sector labels area to flash the stocks in a sector.</li>
<li>Choose what data to display by clicking on the titles to each Axis</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>
2011-02-07- Big boo-boo corrected: Links for NYSE charts had been pointing to NASDAQ charts. Also the notes on this page have been extended
