<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The methodologies used in these spreadsheets is at an early stage of development. The spreadsheets are known to stop or become mixed up. All results should be double-checked.</p>
<p>The charts are built using Adobe Flash and thus will not display on certain smartphones or tablets.</p>
<p>If a chart fails to display, do try to open the spreadsheet. The charts update every five minutes, while the spreadsheets update every minute or so.</p>
<p>Once a chart opens, click on 'Edit this page' in order to access the full spreadsheet and its tabs. If you want to edit things, click on File menu > Make a copy...</p>
<p>Each spreadsheet has two visualization worksheets - see the tabs at the bottom of each spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The sheet titled 'Gadget1' needs a refresh to update. Refresh by pressing F5 or View Menu > Reload or Control-R. Gadget1 is better when you are on an old computer or have a slow Internet connection. Also you can save certain default settings such as starting up with a log scale.</p>
<p>Chart1 updates automatically every minute or so. Use Chart1 if you have a computer with a good graphics card and a fast Internet connection.</p>
<p>Chart parameters:
<ul>
<li>X-Axis shows the percent of gain or loss of a stock since yesterdays close. Look for the zero somewhere near the middle</li>
<li>Y-Axis shows the percent of the current volume compared to the average daily volume. All stock start a zero in the morning and move up during the course of the day.</li>
<li>The diameter of a dot is its relative market capitalization. The larger the market capitalization, the bigger the dot.</li>
<li>The color of the symbol indicates the business sector of the company.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<p>Suggestions:
<ul>
<li>Move your mouse over any of the dots to display its symbol letter and associated data.</li>
<li>Make a zooming window by clicking twice in the chart area. Then click on "Zoom In".</li>
<li>When zoomed in, pan around the display by moving the box in Zoom window in lower right.</li>
<li>Hold your mouse over the colored boxes in the Sector labels area to flash the stocks in a sector.</li>
<li>Choose what data to display by clicking on the titles to each Axis</li>
</ul>
