<p><i>so many numbers...</i><br><br></p>

<p>There are now three publicly accessible 'scenarios' of Jaanga. Each uses a its own technology but the overall idea is the same: 
to help you compare and contrast and come to grips with huge globs of data</p>

<p>You may pronounce the title of the app as "web 3D" or "we be 3D". Your choice.</p>

<p>This is the high end, top-of-the line version of Jaanga and requires a high-end, fast computer. 
You will need a browser that supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank">WebGL</a> 
such as <a href=:http://firefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a> 
or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>. 
Internet Explorer will <i><b>not </b></i>work without installing a special 
<a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">plug-in</a> from Google.</p>

<p>Pricing data is obtained from Yahoo Finance and Google Finance.</p>

<p><b>2012-02-28 ~ Update</b></p>

<p>Currently in development - and demoed recently at the San FranciscoWebGL MeetUp - there are the versions of Jaanga WebD3D:
<ul>
<li>Real-time: gather stock market data in near real-time</li>
<li>Replay: replays stock market data that has been saved</li>
<li>Weather: displays numerous weather attributes in jaanga fashion</li>
</ul>

<p>As of this update only Jaanga Web3D Real-time has been uploaded to Github. The other two will available before too long.</p>

<p>This version of Jaanga is being built on top of spreadsheets created by using Google Docs.</P>

<p>If you are a reasonably experienced creator and editor of spreadsheets, you should be able to adapt these spreadsheets for your own needs.</p>

<p>Price data is obtained from Google Finance and is updated usually within a minute or so of the actual transaction.</p>

<p>This version of Jaanga is built on HTML files with extensive JavaScript. The JavaScript makes use of two frameworks: <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/" target="_blank">Highcharts</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a reasonably experienced at working with JavaScript, then you should be able to adapt this code for your own needs.</p>

<p>Pricing data is obtained from Yahoo Finance and is delayed until about fifteen minutes after the actual transaction.</p>
